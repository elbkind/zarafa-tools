Zarafa scripts and tools
=====
A collection of scripts and programs 'tools' to help you manage your Zarafa system, they are provided as a free service for Zarafa users.

Please make sure you modify the sockets location in the various scripts to suit your Zarafa environment if required.
- Zarafa 7.1 uses /var/run/zarafa
- Zarafa 7.2 uses /var/run/zarafad/server.sock

Notes
====
- Some of newer scripts here require Zarafa 7.2 or python-zarafa from from https://github.com/zarafagroupware/python-zarafa installed.
- Some scripts might not be compatible with some older versions of Zarafa.
- Use them at your own risk !
